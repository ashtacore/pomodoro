Pomo is a small CLI tool that helps you manage your Pomodoro routine. It is a small edit to the `timer` tool by [caarlos0](https://github.com/caarlos0/timer)

## Usage

```sh
pomo <Focus Duration> <Break Duration>
pomo -f <Focus Title> -b <Break Title> <Focus Duration> <Break Duration>
man pomo
pomo --help
```

Several other flags are available:
- `-a` makes the timer take up the whole terminal
- `-n=false` disables the default system notifications
- `-s` will cause a short beep to play when the timer finishes
  - On Linux sounds require permission to access `/dev/tty0` or `/dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr` files for writing, and `pcspkr` module must be loaded. User must be in correct groups, usually `input` and/or `tty`.
  - On macOS, you must enable `Audible bell` in Terminal --> Preferences --> Settings --> Advanced.
  - Note that on some platforms a sound will be included with a desktop notification, making this unnecessary.

You can pause the timer with the space bar.

It is possible to pass a time unit for `<Duration>`.

Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
If no unit is passed, it defaults to seconds ("s").
