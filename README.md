Pomo is a small CLI tool that helps you manage your Pomodoro routine. It is a small edit to the `timer` tool by [caarlos0][https://github.com/caarlos0/timer]

## Usage

```sh
pomo <Focus Duration> <Break Duration>
pomo -f <Focus Title> -b <Break Title> <Focus Duration> <Break Duration>
man pomo
pomo --help
```

You can pause the timer with the space bar.

It is possible to pass a time unit for `<Duration>`.

Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
If no unit is passed, it defaults to seconds ("s").

## Install

**manually**:

Download the pre-compiled binaries from the [releases page][releases] or clone the repo build from source.
